### What’s a Design Pattern?
Design pattern is a typical solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. They are likely the pre-made blueprints that you can use to solve a system problem in your code.

It is not a piece of code that you can just copy in your program and fix the problem, but it is a general concept of solving a particular design problem. You can follow the pattern design and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own code.

Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both describe the solution to a specific problem. The algorithm defines a clear set of actions that can achieve a specific goal, where the design pattern is more about high-level description of a solution.

An algorithm is like a cooking recipe, where you get a clear set of steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand a pattern is like a blueprint where you can see what the result is and the features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

#### Why do you need to learn design patterns?
1. It’s like a toolkit of try and tested solutions to common problems.
2. It teaches you to solve a problem using principles of object oriented designing.
3. It makes it easy for you to communicate with your teammates. You can ask to use the factory pattern to your teammates and they can understand what you are talking about, what is the idea behind your suggestion. No need to explain what factory design is if everyone knows about it and its name.

### Categories of Design Patterns
**Creational:** The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.

**Structural:** The design patterns in this category deal with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.

**Behavioural:** This type of design patterns provide solutions for the better interaction between objects, how to provide loose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in future.

**Cloud Design Patterns** which are Bulkhead, Circuit Breaker, Retry Circuit Breaker, SAGA, Throttling, Queue based load levelling, CQRS - Command and query response.
